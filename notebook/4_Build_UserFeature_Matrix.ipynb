The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

Also 250 is manageable from an operational efficiency perspective where we can offer good service at check-in, coat check and, of course, the bar. No lines. Isn\\'t that nice? :) \\n\\nThe management of The Playwright will deliver upon all of the above with an exceptional level of service.

       "       {'description': 'Title: Charting Collections of Connections in Social Media: Creating Maps and Measures with NodeXL\\n\\nSpeaker: Marc Smith, Chief Social Scientist (CSS) at Connected Action Consulting Group\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nNetworks are a data structure commonly found in any social media service that allows populations to author collections of connections.  The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

Also 250 is manageable from an operational efficiency perspective where we can offer good service at check-in, coat check and, of course, the bar. No lines. Isn\\'t that nice? :) \\n\\nThe management of The Playwright will deliver upon all of the above with an exceptional level of service.

       "       {'description': 'Title: Charting Collections of Connections in Social Media: Creating Maps and Measures with NodeXL\\n\\nSpeaker: Marc Smith, Chief Social Scientist (CSS) at Connected Action Consulting Group\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nNetworks are a data structure commonly found in any social media service that allows populations to author collections of connections.  The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

Yes, 75 TVs, so you can\\'t miss it and we will countdown with state of the art surround sound.\\n❇ Celebratory champagne toast at midnight\\n❇ Full spread of delicious bar food at 1:30am including items you will crave at this point in the night. This includes mozzarella sticks, cheese fries, tator tots, chicken tenders, jalepeno poppers and more!\\n❇ Cocktail attire\\n❇ DJ and dancing\\n❇ Festive decorations with hats, noisemakers and even lots of colorful candy (because everyone loves chocolate)\\n❇ Bottle service and reserved seating options available.\\n\\nThe Top Shelf Open Bar includes a very generous selection of name brand liquors, wine, beer, Red Bull and non-alcoholic drinks. In other words, we will have all the \"good stuff\" :)\\n\\n� Vodka: Grey Goose, Belvedere, Ketel One, Tito\\'s, Absolut, Stoli, Ciroc\\n� Gin: Tanqueray, Hendrick\\'s, Bombay Sapphire, Beefeater\\n� Tequila: Patron, 1800, Jose Cuervo, Hornitos, Sauza\\n� Whiskey: Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, Jameson, Tullamore Dew, Johnnie Walker Black, Johnnie Walker Red\\n\\nWe will also have a specialty cocktail menu of 5 unique drinks prepared just for our event!\\n\\nWe will have 250 guest joining us. We found that this is the right size for a good party. Big enough to feel like a special celebration, but not too big where it feels impersonal. Also 250 is manageable from an operational efficiency perspective where we can offer good service at check-in, coat check and, of course, the bar. No lines. Isn\\'t that nice? :) \\n\\nThe management of The Playwright will deliver upon all of the above with an exceptional level of service. Susan and I plus the rest of my team will work with their staff to ensure a hassle-free, fun, festive and memorable New Year\\'s Eve! We\\'re excited to ring in 2017 with all our friends!!\\n\\nPlease note ticket prices increase automatically on EventBrite based on both time/date and quantity sold triggers.

       "       {'description': 'Title: Charting Collections of Connections in Social Media: Creating Maps and Measures with NodeXL\\n\\nSpeaker: Marc Smith, Chief Social Scientist (CSS) at Connected Action Consulting Group\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nNetworks are a data structure commonly found in any social media service that allows populations to author collections of connections.  The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

       "       {'description': 'Title: Charting Collections of Connections in Social Media: Creating Maps and Measures with NodeXL\\n\\nSpeaker: Marc Smith, Chief Social Scientist (CSS) at Connected Action Consulting Group\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nNetworks are a data structure commonly found in any social media service that allows populations to author collections of connections.  The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

A visualization can bring order to very messy data, but only to a certain limit, constrained by the quality of the underlying data themselves and the quality and rigor with which we analyze them. In this workshop, aimed at audiences with some basic and intermediate familiarity with both visualization and data analysis, we will explore common pitfalls in data analysis and how they manifest in our visualizations. We will explore mysterious outcomes and unexpected behaviors that can influence the efficacy of our visualizations, including problems related to the use of summary statistics, false correlations, confounding variables, and handling null values. For each of these, we will consider their correlates of design and the ways that design choices can reinforce and perpetuate these pitfalls. Along the way, we will learn that ignorance propagates forward very quickly when we might not realize it: what you do not know or understand about your data is amplified in their analysis, visualization, and interpretation.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker:\\n\\nData Analytics and Visualization Specialist\\n\\n\\n**  This workshop is open to all Northeastern students, faculty, and staff.  **\\n\\n**  Please contact Steven Braun at s.braun@northeastern.edu with any questions.  **',\n",

The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

Yes, 75 TVs, so you can\\'t miss it and we will countdown with state of the art surround sound.\\n❇ Celebratory champagne toast at midnight\\n❇ Full spread of delicious bar food at 1:30am including items you will crave at this point in the night. This includes mozzarella sticks, cheese fries, tator tots, chicken tenders, jalepeno poppers and more!\\n❇ Cocktail attire\\n❇ DJ and dancing\\n❇ Festive decorations with hats, noisemakers and even lots of colorful candy (because everyone loves chocolate)\\n❇ Bottle service and reserved seating options available.\\n\\nThe Top Shelf Open Bar includes a very generous selection of name brand liquors, wine, beer, Red Bull and non-alcoholic drinks. In other words, we will have all the \"good stuff\" :)\\n\\n� Vodka: Grey Goose, Belvedere, Ketel One, Tito\\'s, Absolut, Stoli, Ciroc\\n� Gin: Tanqueray, Hendrick\\'s, Bombay Sapphire, Beefeater\\n� Tequila: Patron, 1800, Jose Cuervo, Hornitos, Sauza\\n� Whiskey: Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, Jameson, Tullamore Dew, Johnnie Walker Black, Johnnie Walker Red\\n\\nWe will also have a specialty cocktail menu of 5 unique drinks prepared just for our event!\\n\\nWe will have 250 guest joining us. We found that this is the right size for a good party. Big enough to feel like a special celebration, but not too big where it feels impersonal. Also 250 is manageable from an operational efficiency perspective where we can offer good service at check-in, coat check and, of course, the bar. No lines. Isn\\'t that nice? :) \\n\\nThe management of The Playwright will deliver upon all of the above with an exceptional level of service. Susan and I plus the rest of my team will work with their staff to ensure a hassle-free, fun, festive and memorable New Year\\'s Eve! We\\'re excited to ring in 2017 with all our friends!!\\n\\nPlease note ticket prices increase automatically on EventBrite based on both time/date and quantity sold triggers. Get yours as soon as possible to lock in the current price. \\n\\nAll tickets sales are non-refundable. If you can\\'t attend, you are welcome to give your ticket to a friend who can use it.

The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

Also 250 is manageable from an operational efficiency perspective where we can offer good service at check-in, coat check and, of course, the bar. No lines. Isn\\'t that nice? :) \\n\\nThe management of The Playwright will deliver upon all of the above with an exceptional level of service.

Every code snippet will be a cabinet of riddles, puzzles and a little bit of trickery. Solve the logic of the snippets and implement them in solving the conundrum that lies in your way…\\nElementary knowledge of coding is what one requires for this competition. The snippets will be presented in an easily understandable manner such as to make it easier for non-programmers. It’s a fast paced contest designed to find and reward the sharpest, the fastest and the most accurate logical solution provider. So get your synapses racing and get ready to handle the load of traffic we will be sending through them…\\n\\n\\nCompetition Structure:\\nPreliminary Round:\\nThe Preliminary round tasks competitors with solving a set of logical and intelligence based coding questions. There will be a set of multiple choice types questions which have to be solved in a stipulated time limit. In case of a tie, the team submitting faster will be qualified.\\nFinal Round:\\nThe Final round will be a test of programming skills as well as presence of mind. This phase of the competition tasks the competitors with solving problems of increasing difficulties with the help of code snippets that will be provided. All one needs to do is to first identify what the code snippet actually does and then using the given snippets one needs to solve the given problem in C language. A testing of the program will be held and winners will be decided based on the correctness and elegance of their code. In the event of a tie, the entry submitted first in the coding phase will be declared winner. Rest of the details will be notified on the spot. \\n\\n\\n  Rules and Regulations:\\n\\t1.The number of participants in each team: 2\\n\\t2.Use of USB or mobile phone is prohibited.\\n\\t3.In the final round ,exceeding the time limit may result in negative marking.\\n\\t4.In the final round ,use of any other libraries and header files ,other than <stdio.h> and the given header file, will result in the invalidness of the solution.\\n\\t5.Registration of the event will take place one week before Technoesis.

The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

       "       {'description': 'Title: Learning to Program and Debug, Automatically\\n\\nSpeaker: Swarat Chaudhuri, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University (Houston, Texas)\\n\\nLocation: Northeastern University, 440 Huntington Avenue, West Village H, 3rd Floor, Room #366, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAutomating programming and debugging are long-standing goals in computer science.  In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

A visualization can bring order to very messy data, but only to a certain limit, constrained by the quality of the underlying data themselves and the quality and rigor with which we analyze them. In this workshop, aimed at audiences with some basic and intermediate familiarity with both visualization and data analysis, we will explore common pitfalls in data analysis and how they manifest in our visualizations. We will explore mysterious outcomes and unexpected behaviors that can influence the efficacy of our visualizations, including problems related to the use of summary statistics, false correlations, confounding variables, and handling null values. For each of these, we will consider their correlates of design and the ways that design choices can reinforce and perpetuate these pitfalls. Along the way, we will learn that ignorance propagates forward very quickly when we might not realize it: what you do not know or understand about your data is amplified in their analysis, visualization, and interpretation.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker:\\n\\nData Analytics and Visualization Specialist\\n\\n\\n**  This workshop is open to all Northeastern students, faculty, and staff.  **\\n\\n**  Please contact Steven Braun at s.braun@northeastern.edu with any questions.  **',\n",

The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

       "       {'description': 'Title: Charting Collections of Connections in Social Media: Creating Maps and Measures with NodeXL\\n\\nSpeaker: Marc Smith, Chief Social Scientist (CSS) at Connected Action Consulting Group\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nNetworks are a data structure commonly found in any social media service that allows populations to author collections of connections.  The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.  He is currently researching ways to improve the readability of network visualizations as well as developing the next generation of tools for visually exploring, sharing and collaborating around data and analysis workflows.\\n\\nSome domains Cody has worked on include visualizing concepts from medical records, the spread of infectious diseases, citations in academic literature, interactions of people and organizations, relationships in archaeological dig sites, news term co-occurrence, thesaurus category relationships, municipal energy use and computer network traffic flow.  Cody’s research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, graph & network visualization, data workflows, data & analytic provenance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and personal health informatics.\\n\\nPrior to joining Northeastern, Cody was a research scientist in IBM Watson Health, IBM Watson, and IBM Research.  Cody received his PhD and M.S. degrees in computer science under Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab in 2013 and 2009, respectively.  Cody earned a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Cornell College in 2007.\\n\\nAbout NUVis\\n\\nThe Northeastern University Visualization Consortium (NUVis) is an interdisciplinary cross-university initiative to support the university’s research efforts in visualization and to connect faculty, researchers, and students across campus to foster a visualization community.  Northeastern University’s interdisciplinary focus and structure is an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary field of study, and the goal of NUVis, funded through a collaboration between the College of Arts, Media and Design and the College of Computer and Information Science, is to continue to foster and grow this important area of research.  NUVis sponsors talks and symposia including a bi-weekly seminar, connects faculty and students through its online portal, provides resources to support visualization related research at the university through avenues including workshops and library sponsored open office hours, and hosts and organizes community building events including hackathons and student research poster exhibitions.',\n",

       "       {'description': 'Title: Charting Collections of Connections in Social Media: Creating Maps and Measures with NodeXL\\n\\nSpeaker: Marc Smith, Chief Social Scientist (CSS) at Connected Action Consulting Group\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nNetworks are a data structure commonly found in any social media service that allows populations to author collections of connections.  The Social Media Research Foundation’s NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, network charts become as easy to create as pie charts.  Recent research created by applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations in network structures present in online social spaces.  A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, Facebook and email networks will be presented.\\n\\nWe now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, updates and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.\\n\\nThe Social Media Research Foundation, formed in 2010, was developed to open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation’s current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW.  The Foundation has released the NodeXL project, a spreadsheet add-in that supports “Network Overview Discovery and Exploration.”  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and makes creating a social network map similar to the process of making a pie chart.\\n\\nUsing NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them.  Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the “center” of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikis, blogs and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.\\n\\nAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the book is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains.  Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.\\n\\nA recent report co-authored with the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project documents the discovery of the six basic forms of social media network structures present in social media platforms like Twitter.  The report, “Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters” provides a step by step guide to analyzing social media networks.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nMarc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded and directs the Social Media Research Foundation, a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.  Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups.  Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World, from Morgan-Kaufmann which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.\\n\\nSmith’s research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces.  Many “groups” in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons.  Smith’s goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles.\\n\\nWhile at Microsoft Research, he founded the Community Technologies Group and led the development of the “Netscan” web application and data mining engine that allowed researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.\\n\\nHe contributes to the NodeXL Project that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, Twitter, Flickr, WWW, Facebook and other network data sets.\\n\\nThe Connected Action Consulting Group applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.\\nSmith received a BS in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in Social Theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2001.  He is an adjunct lecturer at the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.\\n\\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****',\n",

Benjamin Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Psychology, College of Science at Northeastern University\\n\\nLocation: 177 Huntington Avenue, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAttention and memory are core aspects of cognition, and they are often studied as though each operates in isolation from the other.  Professor Hutchinson's research takes an alternative, more integrative approach, focusing on how and when these processes interact.  On the one hand, attention might play a role in successful remembering by selecting appropriate cues from the environment to aid retrieval or by enhancing desired and weakening undesired traces from our memory.  On the other hand, memory might impact the way in which we sample the environment by supporting the detection of novel information to be learned or by biasing us toward features and objects that have been useful in the past.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Hutchinson will present two lines of research that seek to better understand this bidirectional relationship.  In particular, he will describe findings from a series of functional neuroimaging studies designed to explore how the brain implements both attention during remembering and memory during ongoing experience.  Lastly, he will discuss one line of ongoing research which aims to articulate the network dynamics of perceptual and memory-based attention.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nJ. Benjamin Hutchinson explores how our experiences from the past influence what we pay attention to in the present.  He investigates the alternating relationship between our ability to form new memories, our ability to remember them, and how that influences how we interact with the world.  His findings could contribute to our understanding of ADHD and other learning conditions, as well as lead to strategies to help people stay focused when attending to a task.\\n\\n \\n**** Please bring your Northeastern University ID (or other photo ID) when entering the building. ****\",\n",

In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals.  For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today’s best program synthesizers.  Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.\\n\\nTwo critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience (i.e., data) and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions.\\n\\nIn this talk, Professor Chaudhuri will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences.  In his framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be “clues” towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task.  Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations.  The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders.  Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.\\n\\nProfessor Chaudhuri will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, he will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis.  He will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nSwarat Chaudhuri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University.  He is an expert on methods for automated reasoning about systems, in particular abstract interpretation and model checking, and the application of such methods in computer-aided programming.  His research lies at the interface of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Much of his recent work is on program synthesis, the problem of automatically generating computer programs from high-level specifications.\\n\\nSwarat received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2001, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.  From 2008 until 2011, he was an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park.  He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Dissertation Award from the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",

The scope of this data has rapidly outpaced our capabilities to analyze and comprehend, so we turn to computers to help.  However, state-of-the-art technology can only supplement the human element.  People assist in each stage of data science, whether it’s data cleaning, understanding algorithm design, exploring computed results, or collaborating and sharing for decision-making.  To present complex information to humans, we use visualizations that leverage our extraordinary perceptual system which can detect trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers almost instantly.\\n\\nA challenging and increasingly important type of data is networks of entities and their relationships.  Networks have been are widely used across diverse disciplines to reason about complex behavior.  These analyses involve understanding relationships, as well as associated attributes, statistics, or groupings.  The omnipresent node-link visualization excels at showing topology and features simultaneously, but many are difficult to extract meaning from due to poor layout or shoehorning inherent complexity into limited space.  The first part of Professor Dunne’s talk will detail techniques for measuring the readability of node-link visualizations and strategies to help users create more effective and understandable visualizations.\\n\\nMoreover, analyses of complex data often requires several sessions, and when returning later it can be difficult to recall the steps in your workflow.  Data science in many domains is also highly collaborative.  Multiple analysts may be working alongside stakeholders with varying expertise and time constraints.  The second part of Dunne’s talk addresses these needs, and he will introduce visualization strategies that assist in making analysis workflows repeatable, free of errors, understandable, and easily shareable.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker\\n\\nCody Dunne is an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science.  He works at the intersection of information visualization, network science, human-computer interaction, and computer science. Cody focuses on techniques for making data easier to analyze and share, as well as the application of visualization techniques to real-world problems.
