### Aashish Vikram Singh, Saurabh Singh, Luxi Zeng, Kaichen Zhang
## Dataset to be analyzed
In our project, we will implement a simpler version of Facebook friends' recommendation system by using the unsupervised learning method. 

To begin building the dataset, we will use the Facebook Graph API, it is the primary way to get data out of, and put data into, Facebook's platform. It's a low-level HTTP-based API which allows us to get the list of friends along with their features and then convert the response into json format for future working. 

Due to the rate limitation of Graph API calls, according to the Facebook Graph API documentation: 
> Your app can make 200 calls per hour per user in aggregate. This limit is calculated based on the number of calls made in the previous hour. When your app is rate limited, all calls for the app are limited, not just ones for a specific user.

Here is our preliminary way of approach: for each of our group member, we will randomly pick 15 of friends from the friend list.
