## Dataset to be analyzed
In our project, we will implement a simpler version of Facebook friends recommendation system by using 
the unsupervisied learning method. 
To begin building the dataset, we will use the Facebook Graph API, it is the primary way to get data out 
of Facebook's platform. And it's a low-level HTTP-based API that we could later use json (? function of json)


## Questions to answer
